## Goal
The goal of this project is to produce a resource that can monitor the GPU temperatures
and regulate fans to maintain a given target temperature. 

## TODO

### Basic
- Get GPU temperatures from the system
- Log results in logfile

### System adjustment
- Target GPU temperature 75 degrees C - regulate fan speeds to meet targets

### Groupme API Integration
- Send alerts to phone if temperatures exceed 80 degrees C
- Query dwarfpool API and post information to GroupMe Chat on request

### Bells and Whistles to the Max
- Submit querys from Alexa
- Graph temperature over time, correlate to hash rate over time
